For this project, I created a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What makes this calculator special is the addition of a toggle button that allows users to switch between light mode ðŸŒ• and dark mode ðŸŒ‘. This provides a better user experience by catering to different lighting conditions and personal preferences.
